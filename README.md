# -MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Descriptive Statistics:
The mean, median, variance, and standard deviation were calculated for the Suspension Coil variable across all manufacturing lots, as well as for each individual manufacturing lot.
Total Summary: The total summary was performed to check if the design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils are met. The design specifications require that the suspension coils have a variance of no more than 100 pounds. The total variance of the suspension coil weight capacities across all manufacturing lots was calculated, and it was found to be 62.29 pounds, which is below the 100 pound threshold.
Lot Summary: A lot summary was performed to determine if the suspension coil weight capacities vary by manufacturing lot. The variance for each manufacturing lot was calculated, and it was found that Lot 1 and Lot 2 meet the design specifications with a variance of 0.98 and 7.47 pounds, respectively, while Lot 3 does not meet the design specifications with a variance of 170.29 pounds.
Overall, the analysis shows that the suspension coils are consistent across most manufacturing lots, but Lot 3 has a higher variance that exceeds the design specifications, which could lead to potential issues with quality control. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the high variance in Lot 3 and to take appropriate action to address it.
